## ðŸ“Š **Project Overview**

The **Car Price Prediction App** predicts the price of used cars based on various features such as:
- Year of Manufacture
- Mileage
- Engine Capacity
- Power
- Seats
- Fuel Type
- Transmission Type

The app also provides a dataset explorer to filter cars by price range, fuel type, and brand.

## ðŸ“ˆ **How It Works**

The **Car Price Prediction App** uses a **Gradient Boosting Model** to predict car prices. This model was trained on a dataset containing various features of used cars such as `Year of Manufacture`, `Mileage`, `Engine Capacity`, `Power`, etc.

### **Flow of the App**:

1. **Predict Price**: Enter the car details, and the model will predict the price.
2. **Explore Cars**: Use the sidebar to filter cars by price, fuel type, and brand.
3. **Visualizations**: Interact with charts to explore relationships between car features and prices.
