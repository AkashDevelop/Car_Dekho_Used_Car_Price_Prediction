## ðŸ“Š **Project Overview**

The **Car Price Prediction App** predicts the price of used cars based on various features such as:
- Year of Manufacture
- Mileage
- Engine Capacity
- Power
- Seats
- Fuel Type
- Transmission Type

The app also provides a dataset explorer to filter cars by price range, fuel type, and brand.

## ðŸš€ **Features**

- **Interactive Filters**: Filter cars based on price, fuel type, and brand.
- **Price Prediction**: Input car features and predict the price of a used car.
- **Data Exploration**: View a dataset of used cars with various features, and explore how car price correlates with different factors.
- **Visualizations**: Interactive scatter plots that help understand the relationship between car price and features such as mileage, engine capacity, and power.

## ðŸ“ˆ **How It Works**

The **Car Price Prediction App** uses a **Gradient Boosting Model** to predict car prices. This model was trained on a dataset containing various features of used cars such as `Year of Manufacture`, `Mileage`, `Engine Capacity`, `Power`, etc.

### **Flow of the App**:

1. **Predict Price**: Enter the car details, and the model will predict the price.
2. **Explore Cars**: Use the sidebar to filter cars by price, fuel type, and brand.
3. **Visualizations**: Interact with charts to explore relationships between car features and prices.
